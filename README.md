⚙️ Core Interests & Practice Areas

My work thrives at the intersection of innovation, interactivity, and open exploration:

- Embedded Electronics & Open Hardware
Designing low-power devices, wearables, and microcontroller-based systems (AVR, ESP, PIC). A firm believer in F.O.S.S. (Free/Open-Source Software) and open hardware as tools for democratized creation.

- Automation, Robotics & IoT
Building systems that bridge the digital and physical—from actuators to autonomous controls and ubiquitous computing, where technology fades into the fabric of daily life.

- Physical & Mathematical Simulations
Modeling complex systems to predict, analyze, and manipulate behavior—applying scientific rigor to real-world phenomena.

- 3D Modeling, CAD & CAM
From conceptual design to prototyping and manufacturing, using CAD/CAM, rapid prototyping, and 3D printing to turn ideas into tangible objects.

- Audiovisual & Sound Creation
Crafting immersive experiences through signal processing (synths, interactive installations) and projection mapping, transforming spaces with light and sound.

- Creative & Live Coding
Using code as a medium for real-time generative art and interactive performances—where algorithms become expressive tools.

- InfoSec (Information Security)
Exploring privacy, cryptography, and ethical hacking—developing tools for security testing and safeguarding ubiquitous systems.

- Data Science
Extracting insights and optimizing systems through advanced analysis, modeling, and scientific computation.

📚 Learning & Interdisciplinary Research
Driven by relentless curiosity, I dive deep into theoretical physics, neuroscience, computer engineering, and beyond. For me, interdisciplinarity isn’t just a method—it’s the foundation of innov[...]

💡 Project Philosophy
I build nontrivial solutions that challenge conventions, merging creative vision with technical precision. My approach:
- ✅ Work smart, not just hard—prioritizing efficiency, elegance, and impact.
- ✅ Turn complexity into clarity—transforming abstract ideas into functional, meaningful experiences.
