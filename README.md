Welcome to my GitHub—where curiosity meets creative technology to build the future.
👋 Engineering as Art, Science, and Expression
I see engineering as the defining "magic" of our era—a bridge between imagination and reality. My work spans S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics), weaving together digital, physical, and human experiences. Here, every project is a step toward shaping what’s next—one circuit, one line of code, one idea at a time.

⚙️ Core Interests & Practice Areas
My work thrives at the intersection of innovation, interactivity, and open exploration:


Embedded Electronics & Open Hardware
Designing low-power devices, wearables, and microcontroller-based systems (AVR, ESP, PIC). A firm believer in F.O.S.S. (Free/Open-Source Software) and open hardware as tools for democratized creation.


Automation, Robotics & IoT
Building systems that bridge the digital and physical—from actuators to autonomous controls and ubiquitous computing, where technology fades into the fabric of daily life.


Physical & Mathematical Simulations
Modeling complex systems to predict, analyze, and manipulate behavior—applying scientific rigor to real-world phenomena.


3D Modeling, CAD & CAM
From conceptual design to prototyping and manufacturing, using CAD/CAM, rapid prototyping, and 3D printing to turn ideas into tangible objects.


Audiovisual & Sound Creation
Crafting immersive experiences through signal processing (synths, interactive installations) and projection mapping, transforming spaces with light and sound.


Creative & Live Coding
Using code as a medium for real-time generative art and interactive performances—where algorithms become expressive tools.


InfoSec (Information Security)
Exploring privacy, cryptography, and ethical hacking—developing tools for security testing and safeguarding ubiquitous systems.


Data Science
Extracting insights and optimizing systems through advanced analysis, modeling, and scientific computation.



📚 Learning & Interdisciplinary Research
Driven by relentless curiosity, I dive deep into theoretical physics, neuroscience, computer engineering, and beyond. For me, interdisciplinarity isn’t just a method—it’s the foundation of innovation.

💡 Project Philosophy
I build nontrivial solutions that challenge conventions, merging creative vision with technical precision. My approach:
✅ Work smart, not just hard—prioritizing efficiency, elegance, and impact.
✅ Turn complexity into clarity—transforming abstract ideas into functional, meaningful experiences.
