# Ahoy!? üëã

Welcome to my GitHub space, where curiosity and a passion for **creative technology** converge to bring innovative and impactful projects to life!

üëã **Engineering as Art, Science, and Expression:**
I believe that **engineering is the true "magic"** of our time, and I am dedicated to unraveling and applying it across the S.T.E.A.M fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics). My journey is about building the future, pixel by pixel and circuit by circuit, exploring the nexus between the digital, the physical, and the **human experience**.

‚öôÔ∏è **My Core Interests & Areas of Practice:**
My passions and areas of practice are vast, interconnected, and centered on **innovation and interactivity**:

* **Embedded Electronics & Open Hardware:** From designing low-power **pocket devices** and **wearable computing** solutions to intricate systems with microcontrollers (AVR, ESP, PIC). I am a strong advocate for **F.O.S.S. (Free and Open Source Software)** and **Open Hardware** philosophies.
* **Automation, Robotics & IoT:** Developing systems that interact with the physical world, from small actuators to the **Internet of Things (IoT)** and autonomous control solutions. My vision extends to **ubiquitous computing**, where technology seamlessly integrates into our environment.
* **Physical & Mathematical Simulations & Analysis:** Building models and algorithms to understand, predict, and manipulate the behavior of complex systems, applying **scientific analysis** and **phenomena modeling**.
* **3D Modeling, CAD & CAM:** From conceptualizing components in **Systems Design** to developing prototypes and final products with **CAD (Computer-Aided Design)**, and advanced manufacturing through **CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing)**, rapid prototyping, and 3D printing.
* **Audio Visual & Sound Creation:** Exploring the creation of immersive audiovisual experiences, from signal processing for **Synths (Synthesizers)** and **interactive installations** to **projection mapping** techniques that transform spaces.
* **Creative & Live Coding:** Utilizing programming as an expressive tool to craft real-time generative art and interactive performances, pushing the aesthetic possibilities of code.
* **InfoSec (Information Security):** A deep interest in privacy, cryptography, and system security, including the development of tools for **ethical pentesting, countermeasures**, and securing **ubiquitous computing** environments.
* **Data Science:** Employing advanced **scientific analysis** and **modeling** techniques to extract valuable insights and optimize the performance of complex systems and processes.

üìö **Continuous Learning & Interdisciplinary Research:**
I possess an insatiable curiosity and am always open to new research and deepening my knowledge in fields such as **Theoretical and Applied Physics**, **Neuroscience**, and advancing my expertise in **Computer Engineering** and **Information Technology**. For me, continuous learning and **interdisciplinarity** are the driving forces behind innovation and creation.

üí° **My Project Philosophy:**
My goal is to craft **nontrivial solutions** that challenge the status quo, seamlessly blending the **art** of creative conception with the **science** of technical execution. My motto is always to **work smart, not just hard**, striving for efficiency, elegance, and innovation in every challenge I embrace, transforming complex ideas into tangible experiences.
